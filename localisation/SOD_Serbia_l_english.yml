In power vacuum that ensued, Alexander regathered his lolists and quickly gained power of Serbiarmed nation of Serbia. Under his leadership they quickly annexed the newly independent state of Montenegro. Alexander swore revenge upon Italy and Bulgaria for the destruction of the Yugoslav nation, and waits for the day he will eventually reunify the Southern Slavic States."
